A Flutter project.

## A London App Brewery Flutter Bootcamp tutorial application.

This is code typed in or copy/pasted in the process of learning to create applications using Flutter.

### This one will be a little different.

In past LAB tutorials, I deleted the Test, Web and Windows directories.

In this tutorial, I will keep the Web directory as I want to also test the Web app part of Flutter.

2022-02-03: I decided to put a hold on this one.
  I think I need to read a Migration Guide for Flutter/Firebase but the code as it was presented wasn't working.
  To learn more, I did do the Google Flutter/Firebase Codelab and that worked but...

  Maybe I will re-visit this in the future. It would be a good exercise to learn how to migrate an app.
