A Flutter project.

## A London App Brewery Flutter Bootcamp tutorial application.

This is code typed in or copy/pasted in the process of learning to create applications using Flutter.

### This one will be a little different.

In past LAB tutorials, I deleted the Test, Web and Windows directories.

In this tutorial, I will keep the Web directory as I want to also test the Web app part of Flutter.
